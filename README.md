*No plaintext passwords ever leave your machine using pwnedpasswords.
How does that work? Well, the Pwned Passwords v2 API has a pretty cool k-anonymity implementation.*

*From https://blog.cloudflare.com/validating-leaked-passwords-with-k-anonymity/:*

    Formally, a data set can be said to hold the property of k-anonymity, if for every record in a released table, there are k âˆ’ 1 other records identical to it.

*This allows us to only provide the first 5 characters of the SHA-1 hash of the password in question. The API then responds with a list of SHA-1 hash suffixes with that prefix. On average, that list contains 478 results.
People smarter than I am have used math to prove that 5-character prefixes are sufficient to maintain k-anonymity for this database.*

In short: your plaintext passwords are protected if you use this library. You won't leak enough data to identity which passwords you're searching for.
